# About
This is a repository I have used as a starter to get familiar developing ðŸ”¥ fast static sites using Gatsby.

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Gatsby
I will be following this [awesome tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/) by the Gatsby team to get started.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Start developing.**

    * Clone this repo
    * Navigate to the project directory
    * Run gatsby-develop

    ```sh
    cd hello-world
    gatsby develop
    ```

2.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`

3. **Create and fiddle around with GraphQL queries using the GraphiQL Explorer**

    The GraphiQL Explorer runs on `http://localhost:8000/___graphql?`
